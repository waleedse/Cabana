              <p className="aboutDetailText">
              A Contract for Difference (CFD) is an agreement between the buyer and the seller. It means that the seller will pay
              the buyer the difference between the commodity’s current price and its price at the point the contract specifies.
               By trading CFDs on commodities, investors are speculating whether the value of the instrument will rise or fall.
              </p>
              <p className="aboutDetailText">
              One of the main benefits of CFD trading is that you’re trading on the expectation of a price movement,
              so you don’t have to actually buy (or take delivery of) the underlying asset. Because you can take a
              short position (expecting the price to decrease) as well as a long one (expecting the price to increase),
              you can still make a profit when the commodity falls in value — not just when it rises. This gives commodity
               CFD traders greater flexibility and more opportunities to earn from market movements.
              By the same token, you should be aware of the potential for losses when going long or short on a commodity’s price.
