                                notice. Example: Client A deposits $1,000 and
                                receives a bonus of $350, if the balance goes
                                into (Minus) -$1 or less, the client will have
                                48 hours for deposit to continue with bonus. If
                                the trader’s own funds withdrawn after bonus has
                                been received, the bonus will be cancelled.
                                Example: If you deposit $1,000 to your account,
                                bonus will be $350, your equity becomes $1,350.
                                You will need to maintain that equity upon
                                withdrawal or transfer. In case it goes below
                                $1,350 then bonus would be cancelled. However,
                                if you make profit, you can withdraw it anytime
                                and it will not affect your bonus.
